# DreamWeaver

DreamWeaver is an implementation of continual meta-reinforcement learning that builds upon the DreamerV3 model. This repository features a shared world model and [adaptive compositional policy initializations](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23d/wu23d.pdf) for task-specific Actor-Critic networks. The framework is evaluated on the [Park environment](https://github.com/park-project/park), which encompasses 12 distinct operating system optimization tasks.
